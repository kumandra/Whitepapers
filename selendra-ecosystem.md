# Selendra Ecosystem of Specialized Network

# Mainnets

This is the currents networks that made up the Selendra Ecosystem of Networks. Each network is a has specialized purpose that focus to serve in its area of solutions. 

Selendra mainchain plays an importaint role to coordinate the whole multi chains system, while others running as permanent parachains. Similar to highway with many lane, except that Selendra is an expandable one. 

Selendra maintains the monestary economy with native token name SEL for all its native permanent parachains with a **Nominated Proof-of-Stake** or **nPoS** consensus. SEL token will be used to pay transactions, storage, computing, bridging and other activity that may require records on each chains. 

Selendra will also open for other networks that developed with special purpose by developers community to join as its parachain. These new parachains can choose to have it own token or joinly use SEL token on their network. If they use SEL, they will become the native parachain. In contrast, if they use their own token, their slot of being the parachain is limimted to 100 weeks slot. After which, they will need to propose to rejoin.

# Mainchain

## Selendra

Selendra core network responsible for two main important tasks, beside other benefits, is to maintain network monastery which is SEL token with the NPoS to be used in the whole multi-networks and provide interchains coordination so other networks can interoperate.

# Native & Permenent Parachains 

## Kumandra

Kumandra's main existent is to gather computing resources and storage capacity to create a decentralized world supercomputer with virtual machine that can be used to compute almost anything from rendering a movies, machine learning, big data analysis, to cosmos study and store any file permanent or temperary. 

Kumandra uses **Proof-of-Resources** consensus to gather and build the system, lease the resources, and charge the users as well as incentivize the resource providers. SEL token will be used for these transactions.

Kumandra virtual marchine is **decentralized virtual private server** as an alternative to centralized VPS that provided by Amazon AWS and others. It could also, thoeratically, be used to run Selendra and other blockchain nodes, websites and anything that need a server.


## Indracore

Indrachain's main existent is to provide the ability write and deploy smart contracts with low transaction fees that most network in the market. It is **Ethereum Virtual Machine** (**EVM**) composibiity as well as **Wasm**. 

Developers can write contract in solidity or used the contract that deployed on Ethereum and others EVM support network to deploy on Indracore and it will works the same way. As well, with Wasm developers can write smart contract in any language that compile into Wasm. This will cut the steep learning curve for developers, thus could help onboard more users to blockchains with their DApps integration.

**Indracore** provides a suite of usecases developed by community developers in the field of but not limited to DeFi, DAO, NFTs. 

## Selendra.ID

This permanent parachain specialized in digital identity and signature. It provides credential to authenticate real world identity and data.   


# Testnests 

## Mainchain

### Selendra Cardamom 

Cardamom is the test network for Selendra multi networks system with multi chain native token that will be used across the whole networks. SEL is the native token for the testnet. 

## Native Parachains

### Indranet
Same as mainnet but for testing.

### Selendra.ID
Same as mainnet but for testing.

### Kumandra
Same as mainnet but for testing.
