# Kumandra Open Network Project

## Overview

Due to a rapid growth of computer development, we now have million times more computing power in our palm than computers that were used to send men to the moon and back in 1960s. Yet, the computers we now have are use to watch short videos,  

In this paper, we discuss excessive computing and other resources which is a result of fast development of microchip A sulotion for peers powered, by the users for the users, decentralized files storage and computing network. 

**Kumandra** provide a system based on **Proof-of-Resources** to aggregrate unuse storage and compunting resources to build a decentralized network of computers that pooled storage and computing capacity together to become a world super computer that could be used to store important personal and world data, rendering software, and much more. This Kumandra Virtual Supercomputer (KVS) can be rented out.

Kumandra uses Proof-of-Resources (PoR) consensus to provide incentives to resource providers, while its tokenomic uses nominated proof-of-stake similar to Selendra Blockchain. Kumandra will be one of the Selendra Parachain that focus on decentralized files storage and virtual computing as it value proposition to the ecosystem and users. Kumandra could provide virtual computing to provide service back to Selendra Blockchain, where users could earn reward double and help blockchain break free from centralized cloud to run its blockchain. 

Kumandra monestary could also be used SEL as it native token, sharing with Selendra monastery system. Making SEL a multi-currency for the blockchain networks.  

## Present of Resources Ineffecient

There are two main group which have computing resources that are either not in good use or just sit idled. 

1. A general computers owner sit idle when they don't use their computer not doing anywork. 

2. Bitcoin & Ethereum PoW (proof-of-work) and other PoW networks has enomous computing power, but the sad thing is that those computers nodes compete to produce a block transaction in a range of time span. While there is only one winner at a time, any others nodes that computed wasted that time. 

While Bitcoin and Ethereum network are two of the most important network for our decentralized economy it is somewhat wasting uneccessary computing resources and electricity. Worst is that those specialized computers node get thrown out of the race, when more hash rate machines enter the competition. 

What if we can use those computers to combine its power to do others useful things on top of the blocks transaction such as storing our human history for the next 10,000 years or more, rendering large file such as movies and much more valuable things that are unimaginable today?

## users persona

## 1. Introduction

Existing giant company like Amazon, Microsoft, Google and more relied on central server, it takes up of alot ofresources and not effienct(I dont know what to write here).

Today, where central server store and provide access to data is expensive and inefficient. They(Data centres) use between 10% of the world's electricity(growing around 10% since 2014).

To reduce these dilemma, we come up with a solution that removes these inordinately expensive central points of
failure, data theift, data leakage, bottlenecks(ineffincies). By developing a fully decentralised replacement
for all Internet based services. Kumandra will ensure the decentralised Internet is a game changing by introducing
Proof of Resources.


## 2. Proof of Resources

In others decentralised networks, they use a proof of 'something' to allow the network to validate actions or servies via a  mathematically verifiable mechanism.

The Kumandra network can validate nodes and their value to the network in a very accurate way. Instead of POS or POW,
Kumandra use PORS which has some significant advantages over others consensus mechanism. Kumandra provides a way to utilized
computer unused resources. This allows the proof to be a useful, computable and an immediately verifiable entity.

Additionally, Kumandra will allows transactions to be made and comfirmed at network speed(maybe under a second, depend on some cases) by using distributed Transaction Manager. Kumandra chooses an unlinked approach to the blockchain. Every user's account
information is held by the group of nodes closest to it (according to the XOR address distance). The Transaction Manager will
only holds a temporary receipt object during the transaction procedure among users. This temporary receipt can be store
forever allowing proof of the transaction to be maintained or destroyed instantly after the transaction is completed, leaving
no trace on the network.

PORS is a consensus mechanism used for utilized computer unused resources. It requires you to share or farm|mine your unused resources, to be randomly selected as block producer, validate new data and verify that transaction is legitimate(Not quite sure about this). By using PORS to utilized computer resources mean that you will allocate static CPU, RAM, and Storage to the chain. This is difference from lending your computer resources on set price, you get incentive by get choosen as block producer(maybe a better word?).


## 3. Incentivisation and Token Distribution

Kumandra network is fully inclusive and enables everyone to get involved and become a part of the project, whether a supporter, resources provider, backer or developer.

## Resources Provider

As resources providers join the network anonymously, they will start a vault(a place where they can share their resources and management location). This vault will add itself automatically to the network and start providing resources. This vault requires
no setup and administation, it is just a simple program to run. The network will be designed to self-manager these resources
and reward 'farmers|miner' accordingly, ultimatly distributed across the network, thereby securing the networks' resources.

The earning speed is based on the resources contributed to and verified by the network. For details of the calculation, we are
working on it.

If people were to try and cheat the system by providing resources and then switch them off, they will lose their ability to
earn. At some point in the future, we will invent a better solution to this problem.

## Backers

To allow distributed ownership of the network, Kumandra will allocate (how many?) of the tokens on day 1. The tokens allocated
are fungible. This allocation will allow two separate entities to be rewarded:

### a: Current Kumandra investors/shareholders.

Currently we have none investors.

### b: Crowd Sale Participants
