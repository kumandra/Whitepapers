#### 1. Introduction

Existing giant company like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and more relied on central server, it takes up of alot of
resources and not effienct(I dont know what to write here).
Today, where central server store and provide access to data is expensive and inefficient. They(Data centres) use between 10% of the world's electricity(growing around 10% since 2014).

To reduce these dilemma, we come up with a solution that removes these inordinately expensive central points of
failure, data theift, data leakage, bottlenecks(ineffincies). By developing a fully decentralised replacement
for all Internet based services. Kumandra will ensure the decentralised Internet is a game changing by introducing
Proof of Resources.


##### 2. Proof of Resources

In others decentralised networks, they use a proof of 'something' to allow the network to validate actions or servies via a  mathematically verifiable mechanism.

The Kumandra network can validate nodes and their value to the network in a very accurate way. Instead of POS or POW,
Kumandra use PORS which has some significant advantages over others consensus mechanism. Kumandra provides a way to utilized
computer unused resources. This allows the proof to be a useful, computable and an immediately verifiable entity.

Additionally, Kumandra will allows transactions to be made and comfirmed at network speed(maybe under a second, depend on some cases) by using distributed Transaction Manager. Kumandra chooses an unlinked approach to the blockchain. Every user's account
information is held by the group of nodes closest to it (according to the XOR address distance). The Transaction Manager will
only holds a temporary receipt object during the transaction procedure among users. This temporary receipt can be store
forever allowing proof of the transaction to be maintained or destroyed instantly after the transaction is completed, leaving
no trace on the network.

PORS is a consensus mechanism used for utilized computer unused resources. It requires you to share or farm|mine your unused resources, to be randomly selected as block producer, validate new data and verify that transaction is legitimate(Not quite sure about this). By using PORS to utilized computer resources mean that you will allocate static CPU, RAM, and Storage to the chain. This is difference from lending your computer resources on set price, you get incentive by get choosen as block producer(maybe a better word?).


##### 3. Incentivisation and Token Distribution

Kumandra network is fully inclusive and enables everyone to get involved and become a part of the project, whether a supporter, resources provider, backer or developer.

##### Resources Provider

As resources providers join the network anonymously, they will start a vault(a place where they can share their resources and management location). This vault will add itself automatically to the network and start providing resources. This vault requires
no setup and administation, it is just a simple program to run. The network will be designed to self-manager these resources
and reward 'farmers|miner' accordingly, ultimatly distributed across the network, thereby securing the networks' resources.
