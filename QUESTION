What does the future of the decentralized look like?

1. Own your data

No one owns or controls your account data except for you.
Ownership extends to original blogs, music, and videos too.
This is all possible through decentralized apps built on decentralized storage.

2. Censorship-resistant content

Today, censorship can come arbitrarily, top-down, and as a tool to silence expression.
Post and share content on Kumandra Protocol.

3 One universal digital identity

Log into Kumandra app with just one ID. Once logged in, your storage and data can follow you across the ecosystem, WEB2 and WEB3.
Allow your friend lists, followers, and content from any Kumandra Procotol.

4. Innovation built for Users

All Kumandra apps are open-source. If one dislike how the app's feature or want to make your own improvement,
you can ask for a change or contribute to the network.

5. Control your data

We want users, not tech platforms should fully control how content moderated. A decentralized internet is not an information
free-for-all. It means that the individual holds the power to personalize their online experinces. For example, users will decide
what contents they want to share public and what to be public.
