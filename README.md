# Kumandra Whitepapers Repository

A plan and propose solution for the next generation of decentralized storage and computing powered by the users, for the users. 

# Proof of concept

## I. Smart Contract based-Marketplace

A market where buyers, on a competitive basis, can find the resources to run their applications. This makes it possible to build extremely scalable and distributed systems, that can achieve performance and efficiency, not available with traditional cloud-based architecture. The aim of Kumandra is to attract  users with unused computing resources and data centers with free computing resources, and to form an open market based on these resources using Fog computing. The goal of the core component is to monitor the chain to check if there is any work to perform. In case there is, the core will orchestrate the work among the different workers that will participate in the computation.


### Fog computing 
Providers can rent their unused computer resources to the network and get paid by helping solve computation task. Eg: CGI Video rendering, Machine learning model, video streaming

The main idea of fog-computing is the use of a decentralized network formed from disparate individual computing devices, as opposed to a single data center structure.

What distinguishes fog computing from cloud services is that in this case the computing resources are decentralized: instead of being provided by some centralized data center or supercomputer or server, the accumulated resource is delivered from 'individual computing devices'.

This makes it possible to build extremely scalable and distributed systems, that can achieve performance and efficiency, not available with traditional cloud-based architecture. The aim of Kumandra is to attract users that have unused computing resource that they want earn some SEL(rather then just leave it for nothing) and data centers with free computing resources, and to form an open market based on these resources.

## II. Deployment Marketplace
People can deployed virtual machine or application by renting computer resource from renter. A platform where client can rent computing resources from resource providers. Example you can rent your unused computer resources by allocated the amount of {CPU, GPU, Ram, Network} and the price of rental like 1 SEL per day.
