## Kumandra Protocol Roadmap and accomplishment so far in 2022.
 
- [x] Learn Substrate
- [x] Studied from Subspace, CESS, IPSE, and many more Decentralized Storage Network.
- [x] Learn IPFS
- [x] Learn Rust
- [x] Learn how to write documents

## Starting from 2023.

- [ ] Release Kumandra Parachain.(Easy)
- [ ] Release Kumandra Whitepaper.(Medium)
- [ ] Write pallets reward-locking and penalty mechanism for storage node.(Medium)
- [ ] Write simple platform for testing Kumandra decentralized storage.(Easy)
- [ ] Write Kumandra-barrel which is a tool for becoming the storage node.(Hard)
- [ ] Write Kumandra client application for End-User that own the data.(Hard)

### Estimate to finished is 3-5 month | `Phase: 1` | `Pay as you go`

## Phase 2
### Storage Packaging
End-User able to purchase amount of storage, they want to rent.
This way, they can save transaction fee, and also cost because if they purchase 10G worth of storage plus, there will be less cost than the feature `pay as you go`

- [ ] Add feature reward-locking for this feature, (just add this feature into the pallet from the phase1).(Medium)
- [ ] Add Storage packaging feature to Kumandra-barrel tool.(Medium)
- [ ] Design fancy storage platform for end-user.(Hard)
- [ ] Create Android|ISO client application.(Hard)

### Estimate to finished is 5 month | `Phase: 2` | `Storage Packaging`

### Permenent Storage Solution
TODO!
