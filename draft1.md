## Blockchain-based Decentralized Storage Scheme

`Abstract`. There are many possible way to achieve decentralized storage solution but what this paper trying to achieve is not only DSN(Decentralized Storage Network) but value of the whole ecosystem. This paper proposes a decentralized storage system based on blockchain technology, and also IPFS which can make full use of
the remaining space of personal hard disks of the users all around the world and a fair decentralized storage network for the storage providers. Storage provider will be decoupled into storage pool. End-user that want to use the platform will pay and the storage fee will given to the pool that
actually store the data from the uploader. In order to provide a fair solution to all storage provider, there is a solution that the system will randomly choose any pool or we can say it is _load-balanced_. All proofs and payment information are stored in the blockchain, which guarantees the
security and credibility of the system.
