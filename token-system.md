## Token System on Kumandra Network  ##

Last Updated 14 May 2022

## 1. Introduction

The Kumandra Network utilises a mathematically complete, peer-to-peer Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) authorisation on an
autonomous network, which mean no human intervention and can't be configure, monitor, and maintain itself independently.
The network is designed to be decentralised and will have the ability to get rid of Domain Name System (DNS). The PKI solution
deployed within the Kumandra network validates a user's identity with mathematical certainty.

## 2. Trusted Group

Kumandra will have a majority of a close group of node that is trustable. While not impossible to generate a majority of malicious
nodes in a close group around a particular target, it should be considered computationally unfeasible.

On Kumandra Network, the following rules ensure a trusted group:
Todo!
